    Content: THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
ELECTRON MICROSCOPE AND OF ELECTRON MICROSCOPY 
Nobel lecture, December 8, 1986 
by 
ERNST RUSKA 
Max-Eyth-Strasse 20, D-1000 BERLIN 33 
A. Parents’ house, family 
A month ago, the Nobel Foundation sent me its yearbook of 1985. From it I 
learnt that many Nobel lectures are downright scientific lectures, interspersed 
with curves, synoptic tables and quotations. I am somewhat reluctant to give 
here such a lecture on something that can be looked up in any modern 
schoolbook on physics. I will therefore not so much report here on physical and 
technical details and their connections but rather on the human experiences - 
some joyful events and many disappointments which had not been spared me 
and my colleagues on our way to the final breakthrough. This is not meant to 
be a complaint though; I rather feel that such experiences of scientists in quest 
of new approaches are absolutely understandable, or even normal. 
In such a representation I must, of course, consider the influence of my 
environment, in particular of my family. There have already been some scien- 
tists in my family: My father, Julius Ruska, was a historian of sciences in 
Heidelberg and Berlin; my uncle, Max Wolf, astronomer in Heidelberg; his 
assistant, a former pupil of my father and my godfather, August Kopff, Direc- 
tor of the Institute for astronomical calculation of the former Friedrich-Wil- 
helm University in Berlin. A cousin of my mother, Alfred Hoche, was Professor 
for Psychiatry in Freiburg/Breisgau; my grandfather from my mother’s side, 
Adalbert Merx, theologian in 
  and Heidelberg. 
My parents lived in Heidelberg and had seven children. I was the fifth, my 
brother Helmut the sixth. To him I had particularly close and friendly relations 
as long as I can remember. Early, optical instruments made a strong impression 
on us. Several times Uncle Max had shown us the telescopes at the observatory 
on the Königstuhl near Heidelberg headed by him. With the light microscope 
as well we soon had impressive, yet contradictory, relations. In the second floor 
of our house, my father had two study rooms connected by a broad sliding door 
which usually was open. One room he used for his scientific historical studies 
relating to classical philology, the other for his scientific interests, in particular 
mineralogy, botany and zoology. When our games with neighbours’ kids in 
front of the house became too noisy, he would knock at the window panes. This 356 Physics 1986 
usually only having a brief effect, he soon knocked a second time, this time 
considerably louder. At the third knock, Helmut and I had to come to his room 
and sit still on a low wooden stool, dos à dos, up to one hour at 2 m distance 
from his desk. While doing so we would see on a table in the other room the 
pretty yellowish wooden box that housed my father’s big Zeiss microscope, 
which we were strictly forbidden to touch. He sometimes demonstrated to us 
interesting objects under the microscope, it is true; for good reasons, however, 
he feared that childrens’ hands would damage the objective or the specimen by 
clumsy manipulation of the coarse and line drive. Thus, our first relation to the 
value of microscopy was not solely positive. 
B. School, vocational choice 
Much more positive was, several years later, the excellent biology instruction 
my brother had through his teacher Adolf Leiber and the very thorough teaching I received through my teacher Karl Reinig. To my great pleasure I recently read an impressive report on Reinig’s personality in the Memoirs of a 
two-years-older student at my school, the later theoretical physicist Walter 
Elsasser. Even today I remember the profound impression Reinig’s comments 
made upon me when he explained that the movement of electrons in an 
electrostatic field followed the same laws as the movement of inert mass in 
gravitational fields. He even tried to explain to us the limitation of microscopi- 
cal resolution due to the wavelength of light. I certainly did not clearly 
understand all this then, because soon after that on one of our many walks through the woods around Heidelberg I had a long discussion on that subject 
with my brother Helmut, who already showed an inclination to medicine, and 
my classmate Karl 
 who later studied medicine as well. 
In our College (Humanistisches Gymnasium), we had up to 17 hours of 
Latin, Greek and French per week. In contrast to my father, who was extreme- 
ly gifted for languages, I produced only very poor results in this field. My 
father, at that time teacher at the same school, daily learnt about my minus 
efforts from his colleagues and blamed me for being too lazy, so that I had some 
sorrowful school years. My Greek teacher, a fellow student of my father, had a 
more realistic view of things: He gave me for my confirmation the book “Hinter 
Pflug und Schraubstock” (Behind plow and vise) by the Swabian “poet” 
engineer Max Eyth (1836-1906). I had always been fascinated by technical 
progress; in particular I was later interested in the development of aeronautics, 
the construction of airships and air planes. The impressive book of Max Eyth 
definitely prompted me to study engineering. My father, having studied sci- 
ences at the universities of 
  Berlin and Heidelberg, obviously regard- 
ed study at a Technical High School as not being adequate and offered me one 
physics semester at a university. I had, however, the strong feeling that 
engineering was more to my liking and refused. 
C. The cathode-ray oscillograph and the short coil 
After I had studied two years electrotechnical engineering in Munich, my 
father received a call to become head of a newly founded Institute for the E. Ruska 357 
History of Sciences in Berlin in 1927. Thus, after my pre-examination in 
Munich I came to Berlin for the second half of my studies. Here I specialized in 
high-voltage techniques and electrical plants and heard, among others, the 
lectures of Professor Adolf Matthias. At the end of the summer term in 1928 he 
told us about his plan of setting up a small group of people to develop from the 
Braun tube an efficient cathode-ray oscillograph for the measurement of very 
fast electrical processes in power stations and on open-air high-voltage trans- 
mission lines. Perhaps with the memory of my physics school lesson in the back 
of my head, I immediately volunteered for this task and became the youngest 
collaborator of the group, which was headed by Dr. Ing. Max Knoll. My first 
attempts with experimental work had been made in the practical physics 
course at the Technical High School in Munich under Professor Jonathan 
Zenneck, and now in the group of Max Knoll. As a newcomer I was first 
entrusted with some vacuum-technical problems which were important to all of 
us. Through the personality of Max Knoll, there was a companionable rela- 
tionship in the group, and at our communal afternoon coffee with him the 
scientific day-to-day-problems of each member of the group were openly dis- 
cussed. As I did not dislike calculations, and our common aim was the 
development of cathode-ray oscillographs for a desired measuring capability, I wanted to devise a suitable method of dimensioning such cathode-ray oscillo- graphs in my “Studienarbeit” - a prerequisite for being allowed to proceed to 
the Diploma examination. 
The most important parameters for accuracy of measurement and writing 
speed af cathode-ray oscillographs are the diameter of the writing spot and its energy density. To produce small and bright writing spots, the electron beams emerging divergently from the cathode had to be concentrated in a small 
writing spot on the fluorescent screen of the cathode-ray oscillograph. For this, 
already Rankin in 1905 [1] used a short dc-fed coil, as had been used by earlier experimentalists with electron beams (formerly called “glow” or “cathode 
rays”). Even before that, Hittorf (1869) and Birkeland (1896) used the rota- tionally symmetric field lying in front of a cylindrical magnet pole for focussing 
cathode rays. A more precise idea of the effect of the axially symmetric, i.e. inhomogeneous magnet field of such poles or coils on the electron bundle 
alongside of their axes had long been unclear. 
Therefore, Hans Busch [3] at Jena calculated the electron trajectories in 
such an electron ray bundle and found that the magnetic field of the short coil 
has the same effect on the electron bundle as has the convex glass lens with a 
defined focal length on a light bundle. The focal length of this “magnetic 
electron lens” can be changed continuously by means of the coil current. Busch 
wanted to check experimentally his theory but for reasons of time he could not 
carry out new experiments. He made use of the experimental results he had 
already obtained sixteen years previously in Gottingen. These were, however, in extremely unsatisfactory agreement with the theory. Perhaps this was the 
reason that Busch did not draw at least the practical conclusion from his lens theory to image some object with such a coil.

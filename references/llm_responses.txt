    Content: THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
ELECTRON MICROSCOPE AND OF ELECTRON MICROSCOPY 
Nobel lecture, December 8, 1986 
by 
ERNST RUSKA 
Max-Eyth-Strasse 20, D-1000 BERLIN 33 
A. Parents’ house, family 
A month ago, the Nobel Foundation sent me its yearbook of 1985. From it I 
learnt that many Nobel lectures are downright scientific lectures, interspersed 
with curves, synoptic tables and quotations. I am somewhat reluctant to give 
here such a lecture on something that can be looked up in any modern 
schoolbook on physics. I will therefore not so much report here on physical and 
technical details and their connections but rather on the human experiences - 
some joyful events and many disappointments which had not been spared me 
and my colleagues on our way to the final breakthrough. This is not meant to 
be a complaint though; I rather feel that such experiences of scientists in quest 
of new approaches are absolutely understandable, or even normal. 
In such a representation I must, of course, consider the influence of my 
environment, in particular of my family. There have already been some scien- 
tists in my family: My father, Julius Ruska, was a historian of sciences in 
Heidelberg and Berlin; my uncle, Max Wolf, astronomer in Heidelberg; his 
assistant, a former pupil of my father and my godfather, August Kopff, Direc- 
tor of the Institute for astronomical calculation of the former Friedrich-Wil- 
helm University in Berlin. A cousin of my mother, Alfred Hoche, was Professor 
for Psychiatry in Freiburg/Breisgau; my grandfather from my mother’s side, 
Adalbert Merx, theologian in 
  and Heidelberg. 
My parents lived in Heidelberg and had seven children. I was the fifth, my 
brother Helmut the sixth. To him I had particularly close and friendly relations 
as long as I can remember. Early, optical instruments made a strong impression 
on us. Several times Uncle Max had shown us the telescopes at the observatory 
on the Königstuhl near Heidelberg headed by him. With the light microscope 
as well we soon had impressive, yet contradictory, relations. In the second floor 
of our house, my father had two study rooms connected by a broad sliding door 
which usually was open. One room he used for his scientific historical studies 
relating to classical philology, the other for his scientific interests, in particular 
mineralogy, botany and zoology. When our games with neighbours’ kids in 
front of the house became too noisy, he would knock at the window panes. This 356 Physics 1986 
usually only having a brief effect, he soon knocked a second time, this time 
considerably louder. At the third knock, Helmut and I had to come to his room 
and sit still on a low wooden stool, dos à dos, up to one hour at 2 m distance 
from his desk. While doing so we would see on a table in the other room the 
pretty yellowish wooden box that housed my father’s big Zeiss microscope, 
which we were strictly forbidden to touch. He sometimes demonstrated to us 
interesting objects under the microscope, it is true; for good reasons, however, 
he feared that childrens’ hands would damage the objective or the specimen by 
clumsy manipulation of the coarse and line drive. Thus, our first relation to the 
value of microscopy was not solely positive. 
B. School, vocational choice 
Much more positive was, several years later, the excellent biology instruction 
my brother had through his teacher Adolf Leiber and the very thorough teaching I received through my teacher Karl Reinig. To my great pleasure I recently read an impressive report on Reinig’s personality in the Memoirs of a 
two-years-older student at my school, the later theoretical physicist Walter 
Elsasser. Even today I remember the profound impression Reinig’s comments 
made upon me when he explained that the movement of electrons in an 
electrostatic field followed the same laws as the movement of inert mass in 
gravitational fields. He even tried to explain to us the limitation of microscopi- 
cal resolution due to the wavelength of light. I certainly did not clearly 
understand all this then, because soon after that on one of our many walks through the woods around Heidelberg I had a long discussion on that subject 
with my brother Helmut, who already showed an inclination to medicine, and 
my classmate Karl 
 who later studied medicine as well. 
In our College (Humanistisches Gymnasium), we had up to 17 hours of 
Latin, Greek and French per week. In contrast to my father, who was extreme- 
ly gifted for languages, I produced only very poor results in this field. My 
father, at that time teacher at the same school, daily learnt about my minus 
efforts from his colleagues and blamed me for being too lazy, so that I had some 
sorrowful school years. My Greek teacher, a fellow student of my father, had a 
more realistic view of things: He gave me for my confirmation the book “Hinter 
Pflug und Schraubstock” (Behind plow and vise) by the Swabian “poet” 
engineer Max Eyth (1836-1906). I had always been fascinated by technical 
progress; in particular I was later interested in the development of aeronautics, 
the construction of airships and air planes. The impressive book of Max Eyth 
definitely prompted me to study engineering. My father, having studied sci- 
ences at the universities of 
  Berlin and Heidelberg, obviously regard- 
ed study at a Technical High School as not being adequate and offered me one 
physics semester at a university. I had, however, the strong feeling that 
engineering was more to my liking and refused. 
C. The cathode-ray oscillograph and the short coil 
After I had studied two years electrotechnical engineering in Munich, my 
father received a call to become head of a newly founded Institute for the E. Ruska 357 
History of Sciences in Berlin in 1927. Thus, after my pre-examination in 
Munich I came to Berlin for the second half of my studies. Here I specialized in 
high-voltage techniques and electrical plants and heard, among others, the 
lectures of Professor Adolf Matthias. At the end of the summer term in 1928 he 
told us about his plan of setting up a small group of people to develop from the 
Braun tube an efficient cathode-ray oscillograph for the measurement of very 
fast electrical processes in power stations and on open-air high-voltage trans- 
mission lines. Perhaps with the memory of my physics school lesson in the back 
of my head, I immediately volunteered for this task and became the youngest 
collaborator of the group, which was headed by Dr. Ing. Max Knoll. My first 
attempts with experimental work had been made in the practical physics 
course at the Technical High School in Munich under Professor Jonathan 
Zenneck, and now in the group of Max Knoll. As a newcomer I was first 
entrusted with some vacuum-technical problems which were important to all of 
us. Through the personality of Max Knoll, there was a companionable rela- 
tionship in the group, and at our communal afternoon coffee with him the 
scientific day-to-day-problems of each member of the group were openly dis- 
cussed. As I did not dislike calculations, and our common aim was the 
development of cathode-ray oscillographs for a desired measuring capability, I wanted to devise a suitable method of dimensioning such cathode-ray oscillo- graphs in my “Studienarbeit” - a prerequisite for being allowed to proceed to 
the Diploma examination. 
The most important parameters for accuracy of measurement and writing 
speed af cathode-ray oscillographs are the diameter of the writing spot and its energy density. To produce small and bright writing spots, the electron beams emerging divergently from the cathode had to be concentrated in a small 
writing spot on the fluorescent screen of the cathode-ray oscillograph. For this, 
already Rankin in 1905 [1] used a short dc-fed coil, as had been used by earlier experimentalists with electron beams (formerly called “glow” or “cathode 
rays”). Even before that, Hittorf (1869) and Birkeland (1896) used the rota- tionally symmetric field lying in front of a cylindrical magnet pole for focussing 
cathode rays. A more precise idea of the effect of the axially symmetric, i.e. inhomogeneous magnet field of such poles or coils on the electron bundle 
alongside of their axes had long been unclear. 
Therefore, Hans Busch [3] at Jena calculated the electron trajectories in 
such an electron ray bundle and found that the magnetic field of the short coil 
has the same effect on the electron bundle as has the convex glass lens with a 
defined focal length on a light bundle. The focal length of this “magnetic 
electron lens” can be changed continuously by means of the coil current. Busch 
wanted to check experimentally his theory but for reasons of time he could not 
carry out new experiments. He made use of the experimental results he had 
already obtained sixteen years previously in Gottingen. These were, however, in extremely unsatisfactory agreement with the theory. Perhaps this was the 
reason that Busch did not draw at least the practical conclusion from his lens theory to image some object with such a coil.

        Whereas the focussing in light optical microscopes is done by glass lenses, electron microscopes make use of rotational symmetric electromagnetic fields to put the electrons back on track. In 1936 Otto Scherzer showed that such lens fields exhibit unavoidable aberrations (spherical and chromatic) as long as the following conditions are fulfilled:
       </p>
       <ul>

OP is the object plane and N0 the coma-free plane of the objective lens, N1 and N2 denote the position of the outer nodal planes of the doublets. These planes are also the coma-free planes of the corrector. The axial fundamental ray is denoted by âarâ, the path of an off-axial ray by âorâ. A double hexapole corrector has been proposed for the first time in 1979 [BEC79]. Off-axial aberrations are as important as axial ones. Therefore, in order to maintain a field of view sufficiently large for materials science applications, a semi-aplanatic objective lens system is required which fulfils the Abbe sine condition. This implies that it has not only to be free of spherical aberration but also of off-axial coma and of parasitic axial aberrations resulting from misalignment. In order to eliminate the radial isotropic component of the off-axial coma the coma-free plane of the objective lens has to be matched with the coma-free plane of the corrector. This is achieved by means of the transfer-lens doublet D1. For reduction of the azimuthal anisotropic component of the off-axial coma the current direction of the first transfer-lens doublet D1 is chosen opposite to that in the objective lens. Thus the off-axial coma is minimized to a value which allows high-resolution imaging of an object area sufficiently large for any practical application. The second-order aberrations of the hexapoles cancel out if the first hexapole is imaged onto the second with negative unit magnification. The spherical aberration of the system is then compensated by the residual negative third-order spherical aberration of the hexapoles. After correction of the third-order spherical aberration, a fifth-order spherical aberration remains [URB99].">

   <!--<p style="padding-right:150px; padding-left:0px; text-align:justify;">The aim to achieve ideal focusing of glass lenses or the problem to compensate for their aberrations, respectively, dates back about 800 years. At that time one started to correct eye defects by means of simple glass lenses. By the end of the 19th century completely corrected systems of glass lenses were available and the wavelength of the light limited the resolution of the microscope rather than the lens defects. The electron microscope developed by Ernst Ruska largely improved the resolution because at medium voltages the wavelength of electrons is about 100.000 times shorter than that of light. This extremely short wavelength far below 1 Çº enables one in principle to image inter-atomic distances in materials. Unfortunately, the large unavoidable spherical aberration of round electron lenses prevents atomic resolution. In 1997, H. Rose, M. Haider and K. Urban achieved atomic resolution by correcting the spherical aberration of electron lenses by means of a novel hexapole corrector. For their achievement they have been awarded the Wolf Prize 2011 in physics.</p>-->
   <!--<h2><em>Optical Lenses</em></h2>-->
   <!--<p style="padding-right:150px; padding-left:0px; text-align:justify;">The history of correction of lens aberrations dates back to the 13th century. With the discovery of the optical lens (the so-called monocle) first corrections of failing eyesight of the eye-lens were accomplished. The importance of refraction of light and of spherical aberration in connection with the lenses was recognized at that time and one began to analyze the effects which prevent ideal imaging.</p>

<p style="padding-right:150px; padding-left:0px; text-align:justify;">Many approaches, both theoretically and practically, have since then been developed to improve the performance of the lenses. Researchers in the 17th century believed that achromatization (i.e. the correction of chromatic aberration, see Fig. 1a) would be impossible<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The reason for this erroneous belief was the false assumption that dispersion and refractive index would be directly related. However, already in the 18th century chromatic correction was achieved by combining two lenses with opposite dispersion<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_2"><sup>2</sup></a> forming an achromatic compound lens which focuses both red and blue light (but not the green light) at the same focal point, as illustrated in Fig. 1b. Around 1770, the first achromatic objective lens was built. However, due to the difficulty to produce these elements, it took several decades before achromats could be mass-produced<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_3"><sup>3</sup></a>. In the early 19th century, the optician Lister<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_4"><sup>4</sup></a> realized that the microscope aberrations could be reduced significantly by proper combination of different lenses. Fraunhofer<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_5"><sup>5</sup></a> incorporated achromatic compound lenses into the microscope whose excellent performance remained unmatched for a long time [FRA17]. The achromatic objectives of the new microscopes consisted of up to four elements (plano-convex + bi-convex)<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_6"><sup>6</sup></a>. The spherical aberration was eliminated by a proper combination of several lenses with positive and negative spherical aberration in such a way that the overall spherical aberration is nullified. In the middle of the 19th century, Lister improved significantly the resolution of the microscope by means of novel compound lenses which eliminate simultaneously several chromatic and spherical aberrations [LIS43].<br/>However, because he never published his findings, they remained largely unnoticed until Ernst Abbe reconfirmed them a few decades later.</p>-->

    The aim to achieve ideal focusing of glass lenses or the problem to compensate for their aberrations, respectively, dates back about 800 years. Towards the end of the 19th century, Abbe developed the theory of image formation in the microscope and provided a scientific basis for the fabrication of microscopes. In 1873, he published his fundamental work on the resolution limit of optical microscopes after he had realized that diffraction determined the achievable resolution [ABB73]. Assuming a perfect lens, he showed that the resolution limit is given by

    . One major achievement in the design of optimum compound lenses was the replacement of the extensive trial and error process by precise calculations of the objective lenses. The new wave theory of optics provided a formal and sufficient basis for the engineering of lenses. As a result, apochromats [ABB86] have been designed which are corrected for three colors. The performance of these lenses was significantly better than that of any previous objective lens. The optical community owes Ernst Abbe not less than 50 important inventions and discoveries. Due to the development of advanced fabrication techniques by Abbe and Zeiss at the beginning of the 20th century, microscope fabrication was concentrated in Germany at that time.

    In 1926, the focusing property of rotationally symmetric magnetic fields was discovered and analyzed by H. Busch. He showed theoretically that a coil carrying a current deflects electrons in the same way as a glass lens refracts the light rays. The lens equation of the light optics can thus also be applied to electrons making it the basis of electron optics. The equation for a short lens is
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="formula 1 over f equals 1 over b + 1 over g" class="clear-block" src="/figures/hardware_ac_formula_2.jpg" title="Formula 2"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here f, b and g are the focal length, the distance between lens and image and the distance between lens and object, respectively. Unlike a glass lens, whose refracting surfaces can be shaped as desired, the electromagnetic field of an electron lens is determined by Maxwellâs equations and cannot be formed arbitrarily. This constraint results in lens aberrations (Fig. 1) which prevent perfect imaging and thus limit the performance of the microscope. The spherical aberration arises in light optics when lenses or mirrors with spherical surfaces are used. This aberration broadens the image of each object point. Based on the pioneering work of H. Busch, it became possible to calculate the paths of electrons in magnetic fields, in particular the focusing properties of coils encapsulated in iron.
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    These short magnetic lenses are the basic elements of all electron microscopes.  After studying the Busch formula for the focal length of magnetic lenses, Knoll and Ruska developed the first single-stage magnetic electron microscope. A short time later, they built a two-stage instrument and named it transmission electron microscope (TEM)

    . Already in 1934, the resolution of the TEM surpassed that of the light microscope [BOR38].
    <!--In the mid of the 20th century, researchers succeeded in mapping lattice planes of crystals. This achievement represents a milestone in high-resolution electron microscopy<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_3"><sup>3</sup></a>.-->

   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    The development of the electron microscope was accompanied by theoretical studies of the properties of electron lenses, multipoles and other electron optical components. In 1936,  Scherzer found the so-called "Scherzer theorem" [SCH36] which states that the spherical and the chromatic aberrations of static rotationally symmetric  and space-charge-free electron lenses are unavoidable if the object and image are real. Spherical aberration of round lenses is always positive  because the marginal rays, which intersect the outer zones of the lens, are always more deflected than the paraxial rays. Scherzer himself showed theoretically, in 1947, that the aberrations can be corrected by lifting any one of the constraints of his theorem. Scherzer has made many ingenious fundamental contributions to the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration of electron lenses. Therefore, he is quite often called "the father of aberration correction" [MSA11]. Nevertheless, he had to defend the validity of his theorem against critics from his competitor W. Glaser who asserted that the theorem was erroneous by proposing a magnetic electron lens free of spherical aberration [GLA40]. In 1941, Recknagel showed that the magnetic field of this lens does not provide a real image and thus does not fulfill the conditions required for the validity of the Scherzer theorem [REC41]. Scherzer proposed several correction procedures (Fig. 2), in particular the C
    <sub>
     S
    </sub>
    -corrected system shown in Fig. 3 [SCH47]. At Scherzerâs time computers were not yet available and numerical calculations very time consuming.
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    From 1948 onwards, theoretical studies and experiments on aberration correction were conducted at Scherzerâs institute in Darmstadt over a period of many years [ROS08]. In 1951, Seeliger showed experimentally that the Scherzer corrector (Fig. 3) compensated for the spherical aberration of the objective lens. However, he could not improve the resolution limit of the basic electron microscope due to electrical and mechanical instabilities of the corrector elements [SEE51].
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    In 1953, Scherzerâs corrector design was used as a basis for correction efforts in England. Archard proposed to substitute four quadrupoles for the two cylinder lenses and the inner round lens of the Scherzer corrector in order to achieve a higher mechanical stability [ARC54]. However, also this corrector could not improve the resolution of the electron microscope.
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    In 1956, Moellenstadt made further experiments with the Scherzer-Seeliger corrector in TÃ¼bingen [MOE56]. By employing critical illumination with a large cone angle of 20 mrad, he increased the spherical aberration to such an extent that it became by far the most dominant aberration blurring severely the image. After compensating for the spherical aberration by the octopoles, the resolution improved by a factor of about 7 accompanied by a remarkable improvement in contrast.
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    In 1957, Scherzer advised his PhD student Meyer to examine the obstacles that limit the actual resolution of the spherical-aberration-corrected electron microscope. In his thesis Meyer investigated both theoretically and experimentally the requirements for achieving an improvement in resolution by correction of aberrations [MEY61]. He realized that two kinds of parasitic aberrations prevented an improvement of resolution: (1) adjustment aberrations resulting from poor alignment, lens imperfections and insufficient shielding of static external fields and (2) time-dependent aberrations caused by electrical and mechanical instabilities and by insufficient shielding of external alternating fields [MEY61].
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    In another thesis performed at Scherzerâs institute, Tretner determined the lower limit of the coefficients C

    </sub>
    and C
    <sub>
     C
    </sub>
    of spherical and chromatic aberration for several constraints [TRE59]. His results have subsequently been utilized by Riecke for designing the so-called condenser-objective lens which minimizes C
    <sub>
     S
    </sub>
    and C
    <sub>

    </sub>
    [RIE66]. This lens is still used in most high-resolution electron microscopes and enables a resolution of about 100Î» for non-corrected microscopes [ROS08].
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    Although Scherzer could show that the departure from rotational symmetry is sufficient to eliminate chromatic aberration, no practical corrector could be found up to 1961 when Kelman showed that the combined electrostatic-magnetic quadrupole can have a chromatic aberration coefficient with negative sign opposite to that of a round lens [KEL61]. In 1967, Hardy first obtained experimentally a negative chromatic aberration with a system of four electric-magnetic quadrupoles [HAR67]. However, it remained a proof of principle because the system could not be used as a corrector for an electron microscope. The successful correction of chromatic aberration in an actual electron microscope was first demonstrated within the frame of the so-called Darmstadt Project by means of a novel corrector. It enabled compensation of chromatic and spherical aberration [KOO77] in 1976. This corrector was composed of three magnetic quadrupoles, two electric-magnetic quadrupoles and three octopoles. During their experiments Scherzer, Rose and co-workers had systematically eliminated the parasitic aberrations which had prevented the successful aberration correction.

    In 1963, Dymnikov showed that a symmetric quadrupole quadruplet with anti-symmetric excitation of the quadrupoles can be used as a substitute for a round lens [DYM63]. Later improved versions of this system served as correctors [ROS71, BEC74, ZAC95, KRI96]. The so-called Chicago-corrector consisting of four magnetic quadrupoles and octopoles was built and tested in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) from 1972 to 1978 [BEC74]. Also this corrector failed to improve the resolution of the STEM.
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    In 1965, Hawkes discovered that hexapoles produce rotationally symmetric third-order combination aberrations apart from other aberrations [HAW65]. His findings remained largely unnoticed until 1979 when Beck showed that a combination of a single round lens and two hexapoles is able to produce a negative spherical aberration [BEC79].  Unfortunately, his systems introduced a large fourth-order aperture aberration which prevents an appreciable improvement in resolution [BEC79, CRE80]. Subsequent studies showed that hexapoles are suitable elements for nullifying successfully C
    <sub>
     S
    </sub>
    because the correctors require fewer elements and can be adjusted more easily than quadruple-octopole correctors [ROS81, CRE82, SHA88, CHE91]. In 1990, H. Rose proposed the semi-aplanat depicted in Fig. 4 which is composed of the objective lens, two round-lens transfer doublets and two hexapoles [ROS90].
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    In following two small companies - CEOS in Heidelberg, Germany and Nion near Seattle in the US - are market leaders for aberration correctors. In 1996, CEOS was founded by Maximilian Haider and Joachim Zach, students of Harald Rose at the Technical University Darmstadt. In 1997, Nion was founded by Ondrej Krivanek and Niklas Dellby, researchers from Cambridge University, UK. CEOS has started with supplying hexapole-based correctors based on the design originally developed by Harald Rose [ROS90, HAI98] and Nion has started supplying quadrupole/octopole correctors originally developed by Crewe and co-workers [THO71, BEC74, KRI99]. The correctors developed by CEOS and Nion have increased the resolution of electron microscopes from about 0.2 nm to better than 0.1 nm over the past decade [BAT02, FRE04].
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    The successful correction of spherical (Cs) and chromatic (Cc) aberration by Rose [ROS05] and the companies CEOS and FEI Electron Optics together with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) [HAI08, KIS08] (Fig. 5, 6) opened the door for improvements of resolution at 80 kV in the so-called TEAM project [KAB09]. After reduction of accelerating voltage to 20 kV [KAI11] and decreasing of Johnson-Noise [UHL13] the final electron microscope SALVE III, equipped with the optimized Rose-Kuhn Cs/Cc-corrector (Fig. 7) [ROS92], was developed and completed by the companies CEOS and FEI Electron Optics together with Ulm University. With this microscope the resolution of electron microscopes was increased up to a new world record of 15 times the wavelength (90 pm at 40 kV) [LIN16].

    Content: THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
ELECTRON MICROSCOPE AND OF ELECTRON MICROSCOPY 
Nobel lecture, December 8, 1986 
by 
ERNST RUSKA 
Max-Eyth-Strasse 20, D-1000 BERLIN 33 
A. Parents’ house, family 
A month ago, the Nobel Foundation sent me its yearbook of 1985. From it I 
learnt that many Nobel lectures are downright scientific lectures, interspersed 
with curves, synoptic tables and quotations. I am somewhat reluctant to give 
here such a lecture on something that can be looked up in any modern 
schoolbook on physics. I will therefore not so much report here on physical and 
technical details and their connections but rather on the human experiences - 
some joyful events and many disappointments which had not been spared me 
and my colleagues on our way to the final breakthrough. This is not meant to 
be a complaint though; I rather feel that such experiences of scientists in quest 
of new approaches are absolutely understandable, or even normal. 
In such a representation I must, of course, consider the influence of my 
environment, in particular of my family. There have already been some scien- 
tists in my family: My father, Julius Ruska, was a historian of sciences in 
Heidelberg and Berlin; my uncle, Max Wolf, astronomer in Heidelberg; his 
assistant, a former pupil of my father and my godfather, August Kopff, Direc- 
tor of the Institute for astronomical calculation of the former Friedrich-Wil- 
helm University in Berlin. A cousin of my mother, Alfred Hoche, was Professor 
for Psychiatry in Freiburg/Breisgau; my grandfather from my mother’s side, 
Adalbert Merx, theologian in 
  and Heidelberg. 
My parents lived in Heidelberg and had seven children. I was the fifth, my 
brother Helmut the sixth. To him I had particularly close and friendly relations 
as long as I can remember. Early, optical instruments made a strong impression 
on us. Several times Uncle Max had shown us the telescopes at the observatory 
on the Königstuhl near Heidelberg headed by him. With the light microscope 
as well we soon had impressive, yet contradictory, relations. In the second floor 
of our house, my father had two study rooms connected by a broad sliding door 
which usually was open. One room he used for his scientific historical studies 
relating to classical philology, the other for his scientific interests, in particular 
mineralogy, botany and zoology. When our games with neighbours’ kids in 
front of the house became too noisy, he would knock at the window panes. This 356 Physics 1986 
usually only having a brief effect, he soon knocked a second time, this time 
considerably louder. At the third knock, Helmut and I had to come to his room 
and sit still on a low wooden stool, dos à dos, up to one hour at 2 m distance 
from his desk. While doing so we would see on a table in the other room the 
pretty yellowish wooden box that housed my father’s big Zeiss microscope, 
which we were strictly forbidden to touch. He sometimes demonstrated to us 
interesting objects under the microscope, it is true; for good reasons, however, 
he feared that childrens’ hands would damage the objective or the specimen by 
clumsy manipulation of the coarse and line drive. Thus, our first relation to the 
value of microscopy was not solely positive. 
B. School, vocational choice 
Much more positive was, several years later, the excellent biology instruction 
my brother had through his teacher Adolf Leiber and the very thorough teaching I received through my teacher Karl Reinig. To my great pleasure I recently read an impressive report on Reinig’s personality in the Memoirs of a 
two-years-older student at my school, the later theoretical physicist Walter 
Elsasser. Even today I remember the profound impression Reinig’s comments 
made upon me when he explained that the movement of electrons in an 
electrostatic field followed the same laws as the movement of inert mass in 
gravitational fields. He even tried to explain to us the limitation of microscopi- 
cal resolution due to the wavelength of light. I certainly did not clearly 
understand all this then, because soon after that on one of our many walks through the woods around Heidelberg I had a long discussion on that subject 
with my brother Helmut, who already showed an inclination to medicine, and 
my classmate Karl 
 who later studied medicine as well. 
In our College (Humanistisches Gymnasium), we had up to 17 hours of 
Latin, Greek and French per week. In contrast to my father, who was extreme- 
ly gifted for languages, I produced only very poor results in this field. My 
father, at that time teacher at the same school, daily learnt about my minus 
efforts from his colleagues and blamed me for being too lazy, so that I had some 
sorrowful school years. My Greek teacher, a fellow student of my father, had a 
more realistic view of things: He gave me for my confirmation the book “Hinter 
Pflug und Schraubstock” (Behind plow and vise) by the Swabian “poet” 
engineer Max Eyth (1836-1906). I had always been fascinated by technical 
progress; in particular I was later interested in the development of aeronautics, 
the construction of airships and air planes. The impressive book of Max Eyth 
definitely prompted me to study engineering. My father, having studied sci- 
ences at the universities of 
  Berlin and Heidelberg, obviously regard- 
ed study at a Technical High School as not being adequate and offered me one 
physics semester at a university. I had, however, the strong feeling that 
engineering was more to my liking and refused. 
C. The cathode-ray oscillograph and the short coil 
After I had studied two years electrotechnical engineering in Munich, my 
father received a call to become head of a newly founded Institute for the E. Ruska 357 
History of Sciences in Berlin in 1927. Thus, after my pre-examination in 
Munich I came to Berlin for the second half of my studies. Here I specialized in 
high-voltage techniques and electrical plants and heard, among others, the 
lectures of Professor Adolf Matthias. At the end of the summer term in 1928 he 
told us about his plan of setting up a small group of people to develop from the 
Braun tube an efficient cathode-ray oscillograph for the measurement of very 
fast electrical processes in power stations and on open-air high-voltage trans- 
mission lines. Perhaps with the memory of my physics school lesson in the back 
of my head, I immediately volunteered for this task and became the youngest 
collaborator of the group, which was headed by Dr. Ing. Max Knoll. My first 
attempts with experimental work had been made in the practical physics 
course at the Technical High School in Munich under Professor Jonathan 
Zenneck, and now in the group of Max Knoll. As a newcomer I was first 
entrusted with some vacuum-technical problems which were important to all of 
us. Through the personality of Max Knoll, there was a companionable rela- 
tionship in the group, and at our communal afternoon coffee with him the 
scientific day-to-day-problems of each member of the group were openly dis- 
cussed. As I did not dislike calculations, and our common aim was the 
development of cathode-ray oscillographs for a desired measuring capability, I wanted to devise a suitable method of dimensioning such cathode-ray oscillo- graphs in my “Studienarbeit” - a prerequisite for being allowed to proceed to 
the Diploma examination. 
The most important parameters for accuracy of measurement and writing 
speed af cathode-ray oscillographs are the diameter of the writing spot and its energy density. To produce small and bright writing spots, the electron beams emerging divergently from the cathode had to be concentrated in a small 
writing spot on the fluorescent screen of the cathode-ray oscillograph. For this, 
already Rankin in 1905 [1] used a short dc-fed coil, as had been used by earlier experimentalists with electron beams (formerly called “glow” or “cathode 
rays”). Even before that, Hittorf (1869) and Birkeland (1896) used the rota- tionally symmetric field lying in front of a cylindrical magnet pole for focussing 
cathode rays. A more precise idea of the effect of the axially symmetric, i.e. inhomogeneous magnet field of such poles or coils on the electron bundle 
alongside of their axes had long been unclear. 
Therefore, Hans Busch [3] at Jena calculated the electron trajectories in 
such an electron ray bundle and found that the magnetic field of the short coil 
has the same effect on the electron bundle as has the convex glass lens with a 
defined focal length on a light bundle. The focal length of this “magnetic 
electron lens” can be changed continuously by means of the coil current. Busch 
wanted to check experimentally his theory but for reasons of time he could not 
carry out new experiments. He made use of the experimental results he had 
already obtained sixteen years previously in Gottingen. These were, however, in extremely unsatisfactory agreement with the theory. Perhaps this was the 
reason that Busch did not draw at least the practical conclusion from his lens theory to image some object with such a coil.

understand all this then, because soon after that on one of our many walks through the woods around Heidelberg I had a long discussion on that subject 
with my brother Helmut, who already showed an inclination to medicine, and 
my classmate Karl 
 who later studied medicine as well. 
In our College (Humanistisches Gymnasium), we had up to 17 hours of 
Latin, Greek and French per week. In contrast to my father, who was extreme- 
ly gifted for languages, I produced only very poor results in this field. My 
father, at that time teacher at the same school, daily learnt about my minus 
efforts from his colleagues and blamed me for being too lazy, so that I had some 
sorrowful school years. My Greek teacher, a fellow student of my father, had a 
more realistic view of things: He gave me for my confirmation the book “Hinter 
Pflug und Schraubstock” (Behind plow and vise) by the Swabian “poet” 
engineer Max Eyth (1836-1906). I had always been fascinated by technical 
progress; in particular I was later interested in the development of aeronautics, 
the construction of airships and air planes. The impressive book of Max Eyth 
definitely prompted me to study engineering. My father, having studied sci- 
ences at the universities of 
  Berlin and Heidelberg, obviously regard- 
ed study at a Technical High School as not being adequate and offered me one 
physics semester at a university. I had, however, the strong feeling that 
engineering was more to my liking and refused. 
C. The cathode-ray oscillograph and the short coil 
After I had studied two years electrotechnical engineering in Munich, my 
father received a call to become head of a newly founded Institute for the E. Ruska 357 
History of Sciences in Berlin in 1927. Thus, after my pre-examination in 
Munich I came to Berlin for the second half of my studies. Here I specialized in 
high-voltage techniques and electrical plants and heard, among others, the 
lectures of Professor Adolf Matthias. At the end of the summer term in 1928 he 
told us about his plan of setting up a small group of people to develop from the 
Braun tube an efficient cathode-ray oscillograph for the measurement of very 
fast electrical processes in power stations and on open-air high-voltage trans- 
mission lines. Perhaps with the memory of my physics school lesson in the back 
of my head, I immediately volunteered for this task and became the youngest 
collaborator of the group, which was headed by Dr. Ing. Max Knoll. My first 
attempts with experimental work had been made in the practical physics 
course at the Technical High School in Munich under Professor Jonathan 
Zenneck, and now in the group of Max Knoll. As a newcomer I was first 
entrusted with some vacuum-technical problems which were important to all of 
us. Through the personality of Max Knoll, there was a companionable rela- 
tionship in the group, and at our communal afternoon coffee with him the 
scientific day-to-day-problems of each member of the group were openly dis- 
cussed. As I did not dislike calculations, and our common aim was the 
development of cathode-ray oscillographs for a desired measuring capability, I wanted to devise a suitable method of dimensioning such cathode-ray oscillo- graphs in my “Studienarbeit” - a prerequisite for being allowed to proceed to 
the Diploma examination. 
The most important parameters for accuracy of measurement and writing 
speed af cathode-ray oscillographs are the diameter of the writing spot and its energy density. To produce small and bright writing spots, the electron beams emerging divergently from the cathode had to be concentrated in a small 
writing spot on the fluorescent screen of the cathode-ray oscillograph. For this, 
already Rankin in 1905 [1] used a short dc-fed coil, as had been used by earlier experimentalists with electron beams (formerly called “glow” or “cathode 
rays”). Even before that, Hittorf (1869) and Birkeland (1896) used the rota- tionally symmetric field lying in front of a cylindrical magnet pole for focussing 
cathode rays. A more precise idea of the effect of the axially symmetric, i.e. inhomogeneous magnet field of such poles or coils on the electron bundle 
alongside of their axes had long been unclear. 
Therefore, Hans Busch [3] at Jena calculated the electron trajectories in 
such an electron ray bundle and found that the magnetic field of the short coil 
has the same effect on the electron bundle as has the convex glass lens with a 
defined focal length on a light bundle. The focal length of this “magnetic 
electron lens” can be changed continuously by means of the coil current. Busch 
wanted to check experimentally his theory but for reasons of time he could not 
carry out new experiments. He made use of the experimental results he had 
already obtained sixteen years previously in Gottingen. These were, however, in extremely unsatisfactory agreement with the theory. Perhaps this was the 
reason that Busch did not draw at least the practical conclusion from his lens theory to image some object with such a coil.

     <!-- <article><h1>Scherzer's theorem</h1>
<p>Whereas the focussing in light optical microscopes is done by glass lenses, electron microscopes make use of rotational symmetric electromagnetic fields to put the electrons back on track. In 1936 Otto Scherzer showed that such lens fields exhibit unavoidable aberrations (spherical and chromatic) as long as the following conditions are fulfilled:</p>
<ul>
<li>the lens fields are rotationally symmetric</li>
<li>the electromagnetic fields are static</li>

        Scherzer's theorem
       </h1>
       <p>
        Whereas the focussing in light optical microscopes is done by glass lenses, electron microscopes make use of rotational symmetric electromagnetic fields to put the electrons back on track. In 1936 Otto Scherzer showed that such lens fields exhibit unavoidable aberrations (spherical and chromatic) as long as the following conditions are fulfilled:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         the lens fields are rotationally symmetric
        </li>
        <li>
         the electromagnetic fields are static
        </li>
        <li>
         there are no space charges
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        These aberrations seriously degrade the performance of electron microscopes. They cannot be corrected by combining rotational symmetric lenses.

OP is the object plane and N0 the coma-free plane of the objective lens, N1 and N2 denote the position of the outer nodal planes of the doublets. These planes are also the coma-free planes of the corrector. The axial fundamental ray is denoted by âarâ, the path of an off-axial ray by âorâ. A double hexapole corrector has been proposed for the first time in 1979 [BEC79]. Off-axial aberrations are as important as axial ones. Therefore, in order to maintain a field of view sufficiently large for materials science applications, a semi-aplanatic objective lens system is required which fulfils the Abbe sine condition. This implies that it has not only to be free of spherical aberration but also of off-axial coma and of parasitic axial aberrations resulting from misalignment. In order to eliminate the radial isotropic component of the off-axial coma the coma-free plane of the objective lens has to be matched with the coma-free plane of the corrector. This is achieved by means of the transfer-lens doublet D1. For reduction of the azimuthal anisotropic component of the off-axial coma the current direction of the first transfer-lens doublet D1 is chosen opposite to that in the objective lens. Thus the off-axial coma is minimized to a value which allows high-resolution imaging of an object area sufficiently large for any practical application. The second-order aberrations of the hexapoles cancel out if the first hexapole is imaged onto the second with negative unit magnification. The spherical aberration of the system is then compensated by the residual negative third-order spherical aberration of the hexapoles. After correction of the third-order spherical aberration, a fifth-order spherical aberration remains [URB99].">

   <!--<p style="padding-right:150px; padding-left:0px; text-align:justify;">The aim to achieve ideal focusing of glass lenses or the problem to compensate for their aberrations, respectively, dates back about 800 years. At that time one started to correct eye defects by means of simple glass lenses. By the end of the 19th century completely corrected systems of glass lenses were available and the wavelength of the light limited the resolution of the microscope rather than the lens defects. The electron microscope developed by Ernst Ruska largely improved the resolution because at medium voltages the wavelength of electrons is about 100.000 times shorter than that of light. This extremely short wavelength far below 1 Çº enables one in principle to image inter-atomic distances in materials. Unfortunately, the large unavoidable spherical aberration of round electron lenses prevents atomic resolution. In 1997, H. Rose, M. Haider and K. Urban achieved atomic resolution by correcting the spherical aberration of electron lenses by means of a novel hexapole corrector. For their achievement they have been awarded the Wolf Prize 2011 in physics.</p>-->
   <!--<h2><em>Optical Lenses</em></h2>-->
   <!--<p style="padding-right:150px; padding-left:0px; text-align:justify;">The history of correction of lens aberrations dates back to the 13th century. With the discovery of the optical lens (the so-called monocle) first corrections of failing eyesight of the eye-lens were accomplished. The importance of refraction of light and of spherical aberration in connection with the lenses was recognized at that time and one began to analyze the effects which prevent ideal imaging.</p>

<p style="padding-right:150px; padding-left:0px; text-align:justify;">Many approaches, both theoretically and practically, have since then been developed to improve the performance of the lenses. Researchers in the 17th century believed that achromatization (i.e. the correction of chromatic aberration, see Fig. 1a) would be impossible<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The reason for this erroneous belief was the false assumption that dispersion and refractive index would be directly related. However, already in the 18th century chromatic correction was achieved by combining two lenses with opposite dispersion<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_2"><sup>2</sup></a> forming an achromatic compound lens which focuses both red and blue light (but not the green light) at the same focal point, as illustrated in Fig. 1b. Around 1770, the first achromatic objective lens was built. However, due to the difficulty to produce these elements, it took several decades before achromats could be mass-produced<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_3"><sup>3</sup></a>. In the early 19th century, the optician Lister<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_4"><sup>4</sup></a> realized that the microscope aberrations could be reduced significantly by proper combination of different lenses. Fraunhofer<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_5"><sup>5</sup></a> incorporated achromatic compound lenses into the microscope whose excellent performance remained unmatched for a long time [FRA17]. The achromatic objectives of the new microscopes consisted of up to four elements (plano-convex + bi-convex)<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_6"><sup>6</sup></a>. The spherical aberration was eliminated by a proper combination of several lenses with positive and negative spherical aberration in such a way that the overall spherical aberration is nullified. In the middle of the 19th century, Lister improved significantly the resolution of the microscope by means of novel compound lenses which eliminate simultaneously several chromatic and spherical aberrations [LIS43].<br/>However, because he never published his findings, they remained largely unnoticed until Ernst Abbe reconfirmed them a few decades later.</p>-->

    The aim to achieve ideal focusing of glass lenses or the problem to compensate for their aberrations, respectively, dates back about 800 years. Towards the end of the 19th century, Abbe developed the theory of image formation in the microscope and provided a scientific basis for the fabrication of microscopes. In 1873, he published his fundamental work on the resolution limit of optical microscopes after he had realized that diffraction determined the achievable resolution [ABB73]. Assuming a perfect lens, he showed that the resolution limit is given by

    <img alt="formula lambda over n times sinus alpha" class="clear-block" src="/figures/hardware_ac_formula_1.jpg" title="Formula 1"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here Î» is wavelength, Î± is the aperture angle and n is the refraction index. This formula is quite universal because it also holds for electron microscopes where the usable aperture angle depends on the aberrations

    . One major achievement in the design of optimum compound lenses was the replacement of the extensive trial and error process by precise calculations of the objective lenses. The new wave theory of optics provided a formal and sufficient basis for the engineering of lenses. As a result, apochromats [ABB86] have been designed which are corrected for three colors. The performance of these lenses was significantly better than that of any previous objective lens. The optical community owes Ernst Abbe not less than 50 important inventions and discoveries. Due to the development of advanced fabrication techniques by Abbe and Zeiss at the beginning of the 20th century, microscope fabrication was concentrated in Germany at that time.

    In 1926, the focusing property of rotationally symmetric magnetic fields was discovered and analyzed by H. Busch. He showed theoretically that a coil carrying a current deflects electrons in the same way as a glass lens refracts the light rays. The lens equation of the light optics can thus also be applied to electrons making it the basis of electron optics. The equation for a short lens is
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="formula 1 over f equals 1 over b + 1 over g" class="clear-block" src="/figures/hardware_ac_formula_2.jpg" title="Formula 2"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here f, b and g are the focal length, the distance between lens and image and the distance between lens and object, respectively. Unlike a glass lens, whose refracting surfaces can be shaped as desired, the electromagnetic field of an electron lens is determined by Maxwellâs equations and cannot be formed arbitrarily. This constraint results in lens aberrations (Fig. 1) which prevent perfect imaging and thus limit the performance of the microscope. The spherical aberration arises in light optics when lenses or mirrors with spherical surfaces are used. This aberration broadens the image of each object point. Based on the pioneering work of H. Busch, it became possible to calculate the paths of electrons in magnetic fields, in particular the focusing properties of coils encapsulated in iron.
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    These short magnetic lenses are the basic elements of all electron microscopes.  After studying the Busch formula for the focal length of magnetic lenses, Knoll and Ruska developed the first single-stage magnetic electron microscope. A short time later, they built a two-stage instrument and named it transmission electron microscope (TEM)

    . Already in 1934, the resolution of the TEM surpassed that of the light microscope [BOR38].
    <!--In the mid of the 20th century, researchers succeeded in mapping lattice planes of crystals. This achievement represents a milestone in high-resolution electron microscopy<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_3"><sup>3</sup></a>.-->

   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    The development of the electron microscope was accompanied by theoretical studies of the properties of electron lenses, multipoles and other electron optical components. In 1936,  Scherzer found the so-called "Scherzer theorem" [SCH36] which states that the spherical and the chromatic aberrations of static rotationally symmetric  and space-charge-free electron lenses are unavoidable if the object and image are real. Spherical aberration of round lenses is always positive  because the marginal rays, which intersect the outer zones of the lens, are always more deflected than the paraxial rays. Scherzer himself showed theoretically, in 1947, that the aberrations can be corrected by lifting any one of the constraints of his theorem. Scherzer has made many ingenious fundamental contributions to the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration of electron lenses. Therefore, he is quite often called "the father of aberration correction" [MSA11]. Nevertheless, he had to defend the validity of his theorem against critics from his competitor W. Glaser who asserted that the theorem was erroneous by proposing a magnetic electron lens free of spherical aberration [GLA40]. In 1941, Recknagel showed that the magnetic field of this lens does not provide a real image and thus does not fulfill the conditions required for the validity of the Scherzer theorem [REC41]. Scherzer proposed several correction procedures (Fig. 2), in particular the C
    <sub>
     S
    </sub>
    -corrected system shown in Fig. 3 [SCH47]. At Scherzerâs time computers were not yet available and numerical calculations very time consuming.
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    From 1948 onwards, theoretical studies and experiments on aberration correction were conducted at Scherzerâs institute in Darmstadt over a period of many years [ROS08]. In 1951, Seeliger showed experimentally that the Scherzer corrector (Fig. 3) compensated for the spherical aberration of the objective lens. However, he could not improve the resolution limit of the basic electron microscope due to electrical and mechanical instabilities of the corrector elements [SEE51].
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    In 1953, Scherzerâs corrector design was used as a basis for correction efforts in England. Archard proposed to substitute four quadrupoles for the two cylinder lenses and the inner round lens of the Scherzer corrector in order to achieve a higher mechanical stability [ARC54]. However, also this corrector could not improve the resolution of the electron microscope.
   </p>

    In 1956, Moellenstadt made further experiments with the Scherzer-Seeliger corrector in TÃ¼bingen [MOE56]. By employing critical illumination with a large cone angle of 20 mrad, he increased the spherical aberration to such an extent that it became by far the most dominant aberration blurring severely the image. After compensating for the spherical aberration by the octopoles, the resolution improved by a factor of about 7 accompanied by a remarkable improvement in contrast.
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    In 1957, Scherzer advised his PhD student Meyer to examine the obstacles that limit the actual resolution of the spherical-aberration-corrected electron microscope. In his thesis Meyer investigated both theoretically and experimentally the requirements for achieving an improvement in resolution by correction of aberrations [MEY61]. He realized that two kinds of parasitic aberrations prevented an improvement of resolution: (1) adjustment aberrations resulting from poor alignment, lens imperfections and insufficient shielding of static external fields and (2) time-dependent aberrations caused by electrical and mechanical instabilities and by insufficient shielding of external alternating fields [MEY61].
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    In another thesis performed at Scherzerâs institute, Tretner determined the lower limit of the coefficients C
    <sub>
     S
    </sub>
    and C
    <sub>
     C
    </sub>
    of spherical and chromatic aberration for several constraints [TRE59]. His results have subsequently been utilized by Riecke for designing the so-called condenser-objective lens which minimizes C
    <sub>
     S
    </sub>
    and C
    <sub>

    [RIE66]. This lens is still used in most high-resolution electron microscopes and enables a resolution of about 100Î» for non-corrected microscopes [ROS08].
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    Although Scherzer could show that the departure from rotational symmetry is sufficient to eliminate chromatic aberration, no practical corrector could be found up to 1961 when Kelman showed that the combined electrostatic-magnetic quadrupole can have a chromatic aberration coefficient with negative sign opposite to that of a round lens [KEL61]. In 1967, Hardy first obtained experimentally a negative chromatic aberration with a system of four electric-magnetic quadrupoles [HAR67]. However, it remained a proof of principle because the system could not be used as a corrector for an electron microscope. The successful correction of chromatic aberration in an actual electron microscope was first demonstrated within the frame of the so-called Darmstadt Project by means of a novel corrector. It enabled compensation of chromatic and spherical aberration [KOO77] in 1976. This corrector was composed of three magnetic quadrupoles, two electric-magnetic quadrupoles and three octopoles. During their experiments Scherzer, Rose and co-workers had systematically eliminated the parasitic aberrations which had prevented the successful aberration correction.

    In 1963, Dymnikov showed that a symmetric quadrupole quadruplet with anti-symmetric excitation of the quadrupoles can be used as a substitute for a round lens [DYM63]. Later improved versions of this system served as correctors [ROS71, BEC74, ZAC95, KRI96]. The so-called Chicago-corrector consisting of four magnetic quadrupoles and octopoles was built and tested in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) from 1972 to 1978 [BEC74]. Also this corrector failed to improve the resolution of the STEM.
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    In 1965, Hawkes discovered that hexapoles produce rotationally symmetric third-order combination aberrations apart from other aberrations [HAW65]. His findings remained largely unnoticed until 1979 when Beck showed that a combination of a single round lens and two hexapoles is able to produce a negative spherical aberration [BEC79].  Unfortunately, his systems introduced a large fourth-order aperture aberration which prevents an appreciable improvement in resolution [BEC79, CRE80]. Subsequent studies showed that hexapoles are suitable elements for nullifying successfully C
    <sub>
     S
    </sub>
    because the correctors require fewer elements and can be adjusted more easily than quadruple-octopole correctors [ROS81, CRE82, SHA88, CHE91]. In 1990, H. Rose proposed the semi-aplanat depicted in Fig. 4 which is composed of the objective lens, two round-lens transfer doublets and two hexapoles [ROS90].
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    In following two small companies - CEOS in Heidelberg, Germany and Nion near Seattle in the US - are market leaders for aberration correctors. In 1996, CEOS was founded by Maximilian Haider and Joachim Zach, students of Harald Rose at the Technical University Darmstadt. In 1997, Nion was founded by Ondrej Krivanek and Niklas Dellby, researchers from Cambridge University, UK. CEOS has started with supplying hexapole-based correctors based on the design originally developed by Harald Rose [ROS90, HAI98] and Nion has started supplying quadrupole/octopole correctors originally developed by Crewe and co-workers [THO71, BEC74, KRI99]. The correctors developed by CEOS and Nion have increased the resolution of electron microscopes from about 0.2 nm to better than 0.1 nm over the past decade [BAT02, FRE04].
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    The successful correction of spherical (Cs) and chromatic (Cc) aberration by Rose [ROS05] and the companies CEOS and FEI Electron Optics together with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) [HAI08, KIS08] (Fig. 5, 6) opened the door for improvements of resolution at 80 kV in the so-called TEAM project [KAB09]. After reduction of accelerating voltage to 20 kV [KAI11] and decreasing of Johnson-Noise [UHL13] the final electron microscope SALVE III, equipped with the optimized Rose-Kuhn Cs/Cc-corrector (Fig. 7) [ROS92], was developed and completed by the companies CEOS and FEI Electron Optics together with Ulm University. With this microscope the resolution of electron microscopes was increased up to a new world record of 15 times the wavelength (90 pm at 40 kV) [LIN16].

    Content: THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
ELECTRON MICROSCOPE AND OF ELECTRON MICROSCOPY 
Nobel lecture, December 8, 1986 
by 
ERNST RUSKA 
Max-Eyth-Strasse 20, D-1000 BERLIN 33 
A. Parents’ house, family 
A month ago, the Nobel Foundation sent me its yearbook of 1985. From it I 
learnt that many Nobel lectures are downright scientific lectures, interspersed 
with curves, synoptic tables and quotations. I am somewhat reluctant to give 
here such a lecture on something that can be looked up in any modern 
schoolbook on physics. I will therefore not so much report here on physical and 
technical details and their connections but rather on the human experiences - 
some joyful events and many disappointments which had not been spared me 
and my colleagues on our way to the final breakthrough. This is not meant to 
be a complaint though; I rather feel that such experiences of scientists in quest 
of new approaches are absolutely understandable, or even normal. 
In such a representation I must, of course, consider the influence of my 
environment, in particular of my family. There have already been some scien- 
tists in my family: My father, Julius Ruska, was a historian of sciences in 
Heidelberg and Berlin; my uncle, Max Wolf, astronomer in Heidelberg; his 
assistant, a former pupil of my father and my godfather, August Kopff, Direc- 
tor of the Institute for astronomical calculation of the former Friedrich-Wil- 
helm University in Berlin. A cousin of my mother, Alfred Hoche, was Professor 
for Psychiatry in Freiburg/Breisgau; my grandfather from my mother’s side, 
Adalbert Merx, theologian in 
  and Heidelberg. 
My parents lived in Heidelberg and had seven children. I was the fifth, my 
brother Helmut the sixth. To him I had particularly close and friendly relations 
as long as I can remember. Early, optical instruments made a strong impression 
on us. Several times Uncle Max had shown us the telescopes at the observatory 
on the Königstuhl near Heidelberg headed by him. With the light microscope 
as well we soon had impressive, yet contradictory, relations. In the second floor 
of our house, my father had two study rooms connected by a broad sliding door 
which usually was open. One room he used for his scientific historical studies 
relating to classical philology, the other for his scientific interests, in particular 
mineralogy, botany and zoology. When our games with neighbours’ kids in 
front of the house became too noisy, he would knock at the window panes. This 356 Physics 1986 
usually only having a brief effect, he soon knocked a second time, this time 
considerably louder. At the third knock, Helmut and I had to come to his room 
and sit still on a low wooden stool, dos à dos, up to one hour at 2 m distance 
from his desk. While doing so we would see on a table in the other room the 
pretty yellowish wooden box that housed my father’s big Zeiss microscope, 
which we were strictly forbidden to touch. He sometimes demonstrated to us 
interesting objects under the microscope, it is true; for good reasons, however, 
he feared that childrens’ hands would damage the objective or the specimen by 
clumsy manipulation of the coarse and line drive. Thus, our first relation to the 
value of microscopy was not solely positive. 
B. School, vocational choice 
Much more positive was, several years later, the excellent biology instruction 
my brother had through his teacher Adolf Leiber and the very thorough teaching I received through my teacher Karl Reinig. To my great pleasure I recently read an impressive report on Reinig’s personality in the Memoirs of a 
two-years-older student at my school, the later theoretical physicist Walter 
Elsasser. Even today I remember the profound impression Reinig’s comments 
made upon me when he explained that the movement of electrons in an 
electrostatic field followed the same laws as the movement of inert mass in 
gravitational fields. He even tried to explain to us the limitation of microscopi- 
cal resolution due to the wavelength of light. I certainly did not clearly 
understand all this then, because soon after that on one of our many walks through the woods around Heidelberg I had a long discussion on that subject 
with my brother Helmut, who already showed an inclination to medicine, and 
my classmate Karl 
 who later studied medicine as well. 
In our College (Humanistisches Gymnasium), we had up to 17 hours of 
Latin, Greek and French per week. In contrast to my father, who was extreme- 
ly gifted for languages, I produced only very poor results in this field. My 
father, at that time teacher at the same school, daily learnt about my minus 
efforts from his colleagues and blamed me for being too lazy, so that I had some 
sorrowful school years. My Greek teacher, a fellow student of my father, had a 
more realistic view of things: He gave me for my confirmation the book “Hinter 
Pflug und Schraubstock” (Behind plow and vise) by the Swabian “poet” 
engineer Max Eyth (1836-1906). I had always been fascinated by technical 
progress; in particular I was later interested in the development of aeronautics, 
the construction of airships and air planes. The impressive book of Max Eyth 
definitely prompted me to study engineering. My father, having studied sci- 
ences at the universities of 
  Berlin and Heidelberg, obviously regard- 
ed study at a Technical High School as not being adequate and offered me one 
physics semester at a university. I had, however, the strong feeling that 
engineering was more to my liking and refused. 
C. The cathode-ray oscillograph and the short coil 
After I had studied two years electrotechnical engineering in Munich, my 
father received a call to become head of a newly founded Institute for the E. Ruska 357 
History of Sciences in Berlin in 1927. Thus, after my pre-examination in 
Munich I came to Berlin for the second half of my studies. Here I specialized in 
high-voltage techniques and electrical plants and heard, among others, the 
lectures of Professor Adolf Matthias. At the end of the summer term in 1928 he 
told us about his plan of setting up a small group of people to develop from the 
Braun tube an efficient cathode-ray oscillograph for the measurement of very 
fast electrical processes in power stations and on open-air high-voltage trans- 
mission lines. Perhaps with the memory of my physics school lesson in the back 
of my head, I immediately volunteered for this task and became the youngest 
collaborator of the group, which was headed by Dr. Ing. Max Knoll. My first 
attempts with experimental work had been made in the practical physics 
course at the Technical High School in Munich under Professor Jonathan 
Zenneck, and now in the group of Max Knoll. As a newcomer I was first 
entrusted with some vacuum-technical problems which were important to all of 
us. Through the personality of Max Knoll, there was a companionable rela- 
tionship in the group, and at our communal afternoon coffee with him the 
scientific day-to-day-problems of each member of the group were openly dis- 
cussed. As I did not dislike calculations, and our common aim was the 
development of cathode-ray oscillographs for a desired measuring capability, I wanted to devise a suitable method of dimensioning such cathode-ray oscillo- graphs in my “Studienarbeit” - a prerequisite for being allowed to proceed to 
the Diploma examination. 
The most important parameters for accuracy of measurement and writing 
speed af cathode-ray oscillographs are the diameter of the writing spot and its energy density. To produce small and bright writing spots, the electron beams emerging divergently from the cathode had to be concentrated in a small 
writing spot on the fluorescent screen of the cathode-ray oscillograph. For this, 
already Rankin in 1905 [1] used a short dc-fed coil, as had been used by earlier experimentalists with electron beams (formerly called “glow” or “cathode 
rays”). Even before that, Hittorf (1869) and Birkeland (1896) used the rota- tionally symmetric field lying in front of a cylindrical magnet pole for focussing 
cathode rays. A more precise idea of the effect of the axially symmetric, i.e. inhomogeneous magnet field of such poles or coils on the electron bundle 
alongside of their axes had long been unclear. 
Therefore, Hans Busch [3] at Jena calculated the electron trajectories in 
such an electron ray bundle and found that the magnetic field of the short coil 
has the same effect on the electron bundle as has the convex glass lens with a 
defined focal length on a light bundle. The focal length of this “magnetic 
electron lens” can be changed continuously by means of the coil current. Busch 
wanted to check experimentally his theory but for reasons of time he could not 
carry out new experiments. He made use of the experimental results he had 
already obtained sixteen years previously in Gottingen. These were, however, in extremely unsatisfactory agreement with the theory. Perhaps this was the 
reason that Busch did not draw at least the practical conclusion from his lens theory to image some object with such a coil.

     <!-- <article><h1>Scherzer's theorem</h1>
<p>Whereas the focussing in light optical microscopes is done by glass lenses, electron microscopes make use of rotational symmetric electromagnetic fields to put the electrons back on track. In 1936 Otto Scherzer showed that such lens fields exhibit unavoidable aberrations (spherical and chromatic) as long as the following conditions are fulfilled:</p>
<ul>
<li>the lens fields are rotationally symmetric</li>
<li>the electromagnetic fields are static</li>
<li>there are no space charges</li>
</ul>
<p>These aberrations seriously degrade the performance of electron microscopes. They cannot be corrected by combining rotational symmetric lenses.</p>
<h2>short vita of Otto Scherzer</h2>
<p>He was born in Passau in 1909. He studied physics at the university of Munich from 1927 until 1931.

        Scherzer's theorem
       </h1>
       <p>
        Whereas the focussing in light optical microscopes is done by glass lenses, electron microscopes make use of rotational symmetric electromagnetic fields to put the electrons back on track. In 1936 Otto Scherzer showed that such lens fields exhibit unavoidable aberrations (spherical and chromatic) as long as the following conditions are fulfilled:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         the lens fields are rotationally symmetric
        </li>
        <li>
         the electromagnetic fields are static
        </li>
        <li>
         there are no space charges
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        These aberrations seriously degrade the performance of electron microscopes. They cannot be corrected by combining rotational symmetric lenses.
       </p>

        short vita of Otto Scherzer
       </h2>
       <p>
        He was born in Passau in 1909. He studied physics at the university of Munich from 1927 until 1931. His thesis under the supervision of Arnold Sommerfeld dealt with the quantum theory of bremsstrahlung. From 1932 to 1933 he was working for AEG dealing with electron optics and he habilitated in 1934. In 1935 he became associate professor at the Technical University of Darmstadt and director of the theoretical physics department. In 1936 he proved his famous theorem. In 1954 he was appointed professor in Darmstadt and he was co-founder of the GSI (Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung).

OP is the object plane and N0 the coma-free plane of the objective lens, N1 and N2 denote the position of the outer nodal planes of the doublets. These planes are also the coma-free planes of the corrector. The axial fundamental ray is denoted by âarâ, the path of an off-axial ray by âorâ. A double hexapole corrector has been proposed for the first time in 1979 [BEC79]. Off-axial aberrations are as important as axial ones. Therefore, in order to maintain a field of view sufficiently large for materials science applications, a semi-aplanatic objective lens system is required which fulfils the Abbe sine condition. This implies that it has not only to be free of spherical aberration but also of off-axial coma and of parasitic axial aberrations resulting from misalignment. In order to eliminate the radial isotropic component of the off-axial coma the coma-free plane of the objective lens has to be matched with the coma-free plane of the corrector. This is achieved by means of the transfer-lens doublet D1. For reduction of the azimuthal anisotropic component of the off-axial coma the current direction of the first transfer-lens doublet D1 is chosen opposite to that in the objective lens. Thus the off-axial coma is minimized to a value which allows high-resolution imaging of an object area sufficiently large for any practical application. The second-order aberrations of the hexapoles cancel out if the first hexapole is imaged onto the second with negative unit magnification. The spherical aberration of the system is then compensated by the residual negative third-order spherical aberration of the hexapoles. After correction of the third-order spherical aberration, a fifth-order spherical aberration remains [URB99].">

   <!--<p style="padding-right:150px; padding-left:0px; text-align:justify;">The aim to achieve ideal focusing of glass lenses or the problem to compensate for their aberrations, respectively, dates back about 800 years. At that time one started to correct eye defects by means of simple glass lenses. By the end of the 19th century completely corrected systems of glass lenses were available and the wavelength of the light limited the resolution of the microscope rather than the lens defects. The electron microscope developed by Ernst Ruska largely improved the resolution because at medium voltages the wavelength of electrons is about 100.000 times shorter than that of light. This extremely short wavelength far below 1 Çº enables one in principle to image inter-atomic distances in materials. Unfortunately, the large unavoidable spherical aberration of round electron lenses prevents atomic resolution. In 1997, H. Rose, M. Haider and K. Urban achieved atomic resolution by correcting the spherical aberration of electron lenses by means of a novel hexapole corrector. For their achievement they have been awarded the Wolf Prize 2011 in physics.</p>-->

   <!--<p style="padding-right:150px; padding-left:0px; text-align:justify;">The history of correction of lens aberrations dates back to the 13th century. With the discovery of the optical lens (the so-called monocle) first corrections of failing eyesight of the eye-lens were accomplished. The importance of refraction of light and of spherical aberration in connection with the lenses was recognized at that time and one began to analyze the effects which prevent ideal imaging.</p>

<p style="padding-right:150px; padding-left:0px; text-align:justify;">Many approaches, both theoretically and practically, have since then been developed to improve the performance of the lenses. Researchers in the 17th century believed that achromatization (i.e. the correction of chromatic aberration, see Fig. 1a) would be impossible<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The reason for this erroneous belief was the false assumption that dispersion and refractive index would be directly related. However, already in the 18th century chromatic correction was achieved by combining two lenses with opposite dispersion<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_2"><sup>2</sup></a> forming an achromatic compound lens which focuses both red and blue light (but not the green light) at the same focal point, as illustrated in Fig. 1b. Around 1770, the first achromatic objective lens was built. However, due to the difficulty to produce these elements, it took several decades before achromats could be mass-produced<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_3"><sup>3</sup></a>. In the early 19th century, the optician Lister<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_4"><sup>4</sup></a> realized that the microscope aberrations could be reduced significantly by proper combination of different lenses. Fraunhofer<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_5"><sup>5</sup></a> incorporated achromatic compound lenses into the microscope whose excellent performance remained unmatched for a long time [FRA17]. The achromatic objectives of the new microscopes consisted of up to four elements (plano-convex + bi-convex)<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_6"><sup>6</sup></a>. The spherical aberration was eliminated by a proper combination of several lenses with positive and negative spherical aberration in such a way that the overall spherical aberration is nullified. In the middle of the 19th century, Lister improved significantly the resolution of the microscope by means of novel compound lenses which eliminate simultaneously several chromatic and spherical aberrations [LIS43].<br/>However, because he never published his findings, they remained largely unnoticed until Ernst Abbe reconfirmed them a few decades later.</p>-->

    The aim to achieve ideal focusing of glass lenses or the problem to compensate for their aberrations, respectively, dates back about 800 years. Towards the end of the 19th century, Abbe developed the theory of image formation in the microscope and provided a scientific basis for the fabrication of microscopes. In 1873, he published his fundamental work on the resolution limit of optical microscopes after he had realized that diffraction determined the achievable resolution [ABB73]. Assuming a perfect lens, he showed that the resolution limit is given by

    <img alt="formula lambda over n times sinus alpha" class="clear-block" src="/figures/hardware_ac_formula_1.jpg" title="Formula 1"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here Î» is wavelength, Î± is the aperture angle and n is the refraction index. This formula is quite universal because it also holds for electron microscopes where the usable aperture angle depends on the aberrations

    . One major achievement in the design of optimum compound lenses was the replacement of the extensive trial and error process by precise calculations of the objective lenses. The new wave theory of optics provided a formal and sufficient basis for the engineering of lenses. As a result, apochromats [ABB86] have been designed which are corrected for three colors. The performance of these lenses was significantly better than that of any previous objective lens. The optical community owes Ernst Abbe not less than 50 important inventions and discoveries. Due to the development of advanced fabrication techniques by Abbe and Zeiss at the beginning of the 20th century, microscope fabrication was concentrated in Germany at that time.

    In 1926, the focusing property of rotationally symmetric magnetic fields was discovered and analyzed by H. Busch. He showed theoretically that a coil carrying a current deflects electrons in the same way as a glass lens refracts the light rays. The lens equation of the light optics can thus also be applied to electrons making it the basis of electron optics. The equation for a short lens is
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="formula 1 over f equals 1 over b + 1 over g" class="clear-block" src="/figures/hardware_ac_formula_2.jpg" title="Formula 2"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here f, b and g are the focal length, the distance between lens and image and the distance between lens and object, respectively. Unlike a glass lens, whose refracting surfaces can be shaped as desired, the electromagnetic field of an electron lens is determined by Maxwellâs equations and cannot be formed arbitrarily. This constraint results in lens aberrations (Fig. 1) which prevent perfect imaging and thus limit the performance of the microscope. The spherical aberration arises in light optics when lenses or mirrors with spherical surfaces are used. This aberration broadens the image of each object point. Based on the pioneering work of H. Busch, it became possible to calculate the paths of electrons in magnetic fields, in particular the focusing properties of coils encapsulated in iron.
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    These short magnetic lenses are the basic elements of all electron microscopes.  After studying the Busch formula for the focal length of magnetic lenses, Knoll and Ruska developed the first single-stage magnetic electron microscope. A short time later, they built a two-stage instrument and named it transmission electron microscope (TEM)

    . Already in 1934, the resolution of the TEM surpassed that of the light microscope [BOR38].
    <!--In the mid of the 20th century, researchers succeeded in mapping lattice planes of crystals. This achievement represents a milestone in high-resolution electron microscopy<a href="/newspress/historical_aspects_of_hardware_aberration_correction.html#ref_footnote_3"><sup>3</sup></a>.-->

   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    The development of the electron microscope was accompanied by theoretical studies of the properties of electron lenses, multipoles and other electron optical components. In 1936,  Scherzer found the so-called "Scherzer theorem" [SCH36] which states that the spherical and the chromatic aberrations of static rotationally symmetric  and space-charge-free electron lenses are unavoidable if the object and image are real. Spherical aberration of round lenses is always positive  because the marginal rays, which intersect the outer zones of the lens, are always more deflected than the paraxial rays. Scherzer himself showed theoretically, in 1947, that the aberrations can be corrected by lifting any one of the constraints of his theorem. Scherzer has made many ingenious fundamental contributions to the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration of electron lenses. Therefore, he is quite often called "the father of aberration correction" [MSA11]. Nevertheless, he had to defend the validity of his theorem against critics from his competitor W. Glaser who asserted that the theorem was erroneous by proposing a magnetic electron lens free of spherical aberration [GLA40]. In 1941, Recknagel showed that the magnetic field of this lens does not provide a real image and thus does not fulfill the conditions required for the validity of the Scherzer theorem [REC41]. Scherzer proposed several correction procedures (Fig. 2), in particular the C
    <sub>
     S
    </sub>
    -corrected system shown in Fig. 3 [SCH47]. At Scherzerâs time computers were not yet available and numerical calculations very time consuming.
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    From 1948 onwards, theoretical studies and experiments on aberration correction were conducted at Scherzerâs institute in Darmstadt over a period of many years [ROS08]. In 1951, Seeliger showed experimentally that the Scherzer corrector (Fig. 3) compensated for the spherical aberration of the objective lens. However, he could not improve the resolution limit of the basic electron microscope due to electrical and mechanical instabilities of the corrector elements [SEE51].
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    In 1953, Scherzerâs corrector design was used as a basis for correction efforts in England. Archard proposed to substitute four quadrupoles for the two cylinder lenses and the inner round lens of the Scherzer corrector in order to achieve a higher mechanical stability [ARC54]. However, also this corrector could not improve the resolution of the electron microscope.
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    In 1956, Moellenstadt made further experiments with the Scherzer-Seeliger corrector in TÃ¼bingen [MOE56]. By employing critical illumination with a large cone angle of 20 mrad, he increased the spherical aberration to such an extent that it became by far the most dominant aberration blurring severely the image. After compensating for the spherical aberration by the octopoles, the resolution improved by a factor of about 7 accompanied by a remarkable improvement in contrast.

   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    In 1957, Scherzer advised his PhD student Meyer to examine the obstacles that limit the actual resolution of the spherical-aberration-corrected electron microscope. In his thesis Meyer investigated both theoretically and experimentally the requirements for achieving an improvement in resolution by correction of aberrations [MEY61]. He realized that two kinds of parasitic aberrations prevented an improvement of resolution: (1) adjustment aberrations resulting from poor alignment, lens imperfections and insufficient shielding of static external fields and (2) time-dependent aberrations caused by electrical and mechanical instabilities and by insufficient shielding of external alternating fields [MEY61].
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    In another thesis performed at Scherzerâs institute, Tretner determined the lower limit of the coefficients C
    <sub>
     S
    </sub>
    and C
    <sub>
     C
    </sub>
    of spherical and chromatic aberration for several constraints [TRE59]. His results have subsequently been utilized by Riecke for designing the so-called condenser-objective lens which minimizes C
    <sub>
     S
    </sub>
    and C
    <sub>
     C
    </sub>
    [RIE66]. This lens is still used in most high-resolution electron microscopes and enables a resolution of about 100Î» for non-corrected microscopes [ROS08].
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    Although Scherzer could show that the departure from rotational symmetry is sufficient to eliminate chromatic aberration, no practical corrector could be found up to 1961 when Kelman showed that the combined electrostatic-magnetic quadrupole can have a chromatic aberration coefficient with negative sign opposite to that of a round lens [KEL61]. In 1967, Hardy first obtained experimentally a negative chromatic aberration with a system of four electric-magnetic quadrupoles [HAR67]. However, it remained a proof of principle because the system could not be used as a corrector for an electron microscope. The successful correction of chromatic aberration in an actual electron microscope was first demonstrated within the frame of the so-called Darmstadt Project by means of a novel corrector. It enabled compensation of chromatic and spherical aberration [KOO77] in 1976. This corrector was composed of three magnetic quadrupoles, two electric-magnetic quadrupoles and three octopoles. During their experiments Scherzer, Rose and co-workers had systematically eliminated the parasitic aberrations which had prevented the successful aberration correction.

    In 1963, Dymnikov showed that a symmetric quadrupole quadruplet with anti-symmetric excitation of the quadrupoles can be used as a substitute for a round lens [DYM63]. Later improved versions of this system served as correctors [ROS71, BEC74, ZAC95, KRI96]. The so-called Chicago-corrector consisting of four magnetic quadrupoles and octopoles was built and tested in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) from 1972 to 1978 [BEC74]. Also this corrector failed to improve the resolution of the STEM.
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    In 1965, Hawkes discovered that hexapoles produce rotationally symmetric third-order combination aberrations apart from other aberrations [HAW65]. His findings remained largely unnoticed until 1979 when Beck showed that a combination of a single round lens and two hexapoles is able to produce a negative spherical aberration [BEC79].  Unfortunately, his systems introduced a large fourth-order aperture aberration which prevents an appreciable improvement in resolution [BEC79, CRE80]. Subsequent studies showed that hexapoles are suitable elements for nullifying successfully C
    <sub>
     S
    </sub>
    because the correctors require fewer elements and can be adjusted more easily than quadruple-octopole correctors [ROS81, CRE82, SHA88, CHE91]. In 1990, H. Rose proposed the semi-aplanat depicted in Fig. 4 which is composed of the objective lens, two round-lens transfer doublets and two hexapoles [ROS90].
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    In following two small companies - CEOS in Heidelberg, Germany and Nion near Seattle in the US - are market leaders for aberration correctors. In 1996, CEOS was founded by Maximilian Haider and Joachim Zach, students of Harald Rose at the Technical University Darmstadt. In 1997, Nion was founded by Ondrej Krivanek and Niklas Dellby, researchers from Cambridge University, UK. CEOS has started with supplying hexapole-based correctors based on the design originally developed by Harald Rose [ROS90, HAI98] and Nion has started supplying quadrupole/octopole correctors originally developed by Crewe and co-workers [THO71, BEC74, KRI99]. The correctors developed by CEOS and Nion have increased the resolution of electron microscopes from about 0.2 nm to better than 0.1 nm over the past decade [BAT02, FRE04].
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:0px; padding-right:150px;">
    The successful correction of spherical (Cs) and chromatic (Cc) aberration by Rose [ROS05] and the companies CEOS and FEI Electron Optics together with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) [HAI08, KIS08] (Fig. 5, 6) opened the door for improvements of resolution at 80 kV in the so-called TEAM project [KAB09]. After reduction of accelerating voltage to 20 kV [KAI11] and decreasing of Johnson-Noise [UHL13] the final electron microscope SALVE III, equipped with the optimized Rose-Kuhn Cs/Cc-corrector (Fig. 7) [ROS92], was developed and completed by the companies CEOS and FEI Electron Optics together with Ulm University. With this microscope the resolution of electron microscopes was increased up to a new world record of 15 times the wavelength (90 pm at 40 kV) [LIN16].
